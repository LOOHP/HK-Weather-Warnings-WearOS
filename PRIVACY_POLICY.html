    <h1>HK Weather (WearOS) Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have <strong>not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only data stored locally on your device is your preferred language and weather location, which can be <strong>simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Background Access GPS information</strong> (active periodically even when the app is closed or not in use) used to locate your nearest weather station (if opted in) is <strong>only used at the moment and is not stored or collected</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTTPS Requests are made to the above data sources to retrieve weather information. <strong>No personally identifiable information</strong> (apart from information essentially needed to perform a request, such as the IP address) is sent in such requests.
